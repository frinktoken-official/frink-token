## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Token Holders

#### Wallet Security

**✅ DO:**
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Enable 2FA on all accounts
- Verify contract addresses before transactions
- Keep seed phrases offline and secure
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Keep wallet software updated

**❌ DON'T:**
- Share your private key or seed phrase with ANYONE
- Store sensitive info in cloud services
- Use the same password across sites
- Connect wallet to unknown dApps
- Trust unsolicited DMs
- Click suspicious links

#### Transaction Safety

**Before every transaction:**
1. ✅ Verify contract address: `0x822AC53a3037d328645B5aa7d6A07360AcC23433`
2. ✅ Check you're on official website: `frinktoken.net`
3. ✅ Confirm network: Polygon PoS (Chain ID: 137)
4. ✅ Review transaction details carefully
5. ✅ Start with small test transactions

#### Common Scams

🚨 **Watch out for:**
- Fake FRINK tokens (different contract address)
- Phishing websites (similar domain names)
- Impersonator accounts (fake team members)
- "Too good to be true" offers
- Urgent DMs asking for action
- Fake support asking for keys/phrases

---

### For Developers

#### Smart Contract Interaction

```solidity
// Always verify contract address
address constant FRINK_CONTRACT = 0x822AC53a3037d328645B5aa7d6A07360AcC23433;

// Use safeTransfer for ERC20
IERC20(FRINK_CONTRACT).safeTransfer(recipient, amount);

// Check return values
require(success, "Transfer failed");
```

#### API/Integration Security

- ✅ Validate all inputs
- ✅ Use rate limiting
- ✅ Implement proper error handling
- ✅ Never expose private keys in code
- ✅ Use environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated

---

#### Smart Contract
- ✅ **Standard ERC-20:** Well-tested implementation
- ✅ **Verified on PolygonScan:** Public source code

- ✅ **Deployed on Polygon PoS:** Secure, established network

#### Liquidity
- ✅ **LP NFT locked until November 25, 2026** via Team Finance

- ✅ **LP tokens secured:** Team Finance custody of NFT 177734 until unlock

#### Infrastructure
- ✅ **HTTPS enabled:** Site served on frinktoken.net
- ⚠️ **No professional audit** of the token contract
- ⚠️ **No bug bounty program** (target was Q1 2026; reports still go to contact@frinktoken.net)
